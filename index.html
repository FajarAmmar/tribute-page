        <h3>Here a timeline of Eminem Career</h3>
        <ul>
          <!-- Timeline-1 -->
          <li><strong>December 25, 1995</strong><br />Eminem is born Marshall Bruce Mathers III in St. Joseph, Missouri. He eventually settles in Warren, Michigan.</li>
          <!-- Timeline-2 -->
          <li>
            <strong>October 17, 1972</strong><br />Eminem's daughter, Hailie Jade, is born. He mentions her in many of his songs, and in 1999 her cooing appears on his track "'97 Bonnie & Clyde"
            (where Em imagines killing Hailie's mother, Kim). Eminem gets her name tattooed on his arm.
          </li>
          <!-- Timeline-3 -->
          <li><strong>February 23, 1999</strong><br />Eminem drops his first major-label album, The Slim Shady LP. He quickly becomes the most controversial rapper in the game.</li>
          <!-- Timeline-4 -->
          <li>
            <strong>September 17, 1999</strong><br />Eminem's mother, Debbie Mathers-Briggs, files a lawsuit against him, claiming that his allegations in the press and on records that she was an
            unfit mother have ruined her life, as she can no longer get a job or a line of credit. In his song "My Name Is," Eminem raps: "I just found out my mom does more dope than I do." The case
            is eventually settled for $25,000.
          </li>
          <!-- Timeline-5 -->
          <li>
            <strong>July 8, 2000</strong><br />"The Real Slim Shady" debuts at #1 in the UK, giving Eminem his first chart-topper on the Singles chart. He doesn't reach #1 in America until two years
            later with "Lose Yourself."
          </li>
          <!-- Timeline-6 -->
          <li>
            <strong>December 16, 2000</strong><br />Eminem lands his second UK #1 when "Stan" tops the chart. The song, which tells the story of a deranged, obsessive fan, samples the lilting Dido
            song "Thank You," giving her a huge boost in America.
          </li>
          <!-- Timeline-7 -->
          <li><strong>October 5, 2001</strong><br />After months of wrangling over child support, rapper Eminem's divorce becomes official.</li>
          <!-- Timeline-8 -->
          <li>
            <strong>March 23, 2002</strong><br />At the 75th Academy Awards, Eminem becomes the first rapper to take home an Oscar when "Lose Yourself," from his semi-biographical film 8 Mile, wins
            Best Original Song. Eminem doesn't bother to attend the ceremony, thinking he has no chance of winning, so his friend and producer Luis Resto accepts the honor in his absence.
          </li>
          <!-- Timeline-9 -->
          <li><strong>June 2, 2002</strong><br />Eminem's The Eminem Show hits #1 on both the UK and US album charts.</li>
          <!-- Timeline-10 -->
          <li>
            <strong>June 1, 2002</strong><br />Eminem, still without an American chart-topper, lands his third UK #1 hit with "Without Me," where he takes shots at a number of soft targets including
            Chris Kirkpatrick, Limp Bizkit and Moby.
          </li>
          <!-- Timeline-11 -->
          <li><strong>November 19, 2002</strong><br />Eminem hits #1 on the Hot 100 for the first time when "Lose Yourself," from his movie 8 Mile, tops the chart.</li>
          <!-- Timeline-12 -->
          <li>
            <strong>November 8, 2002</strong><br />8 Mile, a semi-biographical look at Eminem's early days as a struggling rapper in Detroit, opens in theaters. The film is a critical and commercial
            success, and Eminem's "Lose Yourself" becomes the first rap song to win the Oscar for Best Original Song.
          </li>
          <!-- Timeline-13 -->
          <li>

            which also promotes his album Encore.
          </li>
          <!-- Timeline-14 -->
          <li>
            <strong>June 1, 2017</strong><br />Thanks to the song by Eminem, the word "stan" is added to the Oxford American Dictionary, defined as "an overzealous or obsessive fan of a particular
            celebrity."
          </li>
          <!-- Timeline-15 -->
          <li>
            <strong>January 16, 2018</strong><br />Eminem is questioned by the Secret Service about lyrics in his song "Framed," where he imagines Ivanka Trump murdered in the trunk of his car. Agents
            determine he is not a threat; Eminem later raps about it on his song "The Ringer": "Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service to meet in person."
          </li>
          <!-- Timeline-16 -->
          <li>
            <strong>September 29, 2021</strong><br />In downtown Detroit, Eminem opens the restaurant Mom's Spaghetti, named after a line in his song "Lose Yourself." The first fans in line are served
            by Slim Shady himself.

          >"Cause sometimes, you just feel tired. Feel weak. And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up. But you gotta search within you. You gotta find that inner strength, and just
          pull that shit out of you. And get that motivation to NOT give up and NOT be a quitter. No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse."</i
